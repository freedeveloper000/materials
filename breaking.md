axe layout-padding

{hide,show,block,inline-block}-{sm,md,lg} are gone

All css problems with display: {block,inline-block} overriding are solved

hide-phone hides only on phone (0 <= size <= sm)
hide-tablet hides only on tablet (sm <= size <= md)
hide-bigtablet hides only on monitor (md <= size <= lg)
hide-desktop hides only on huge (lg <= size)

deprecate layout-align?

layout-vertical has been renamed to layout-column
layout-horizontal has been renamed to layout-row
