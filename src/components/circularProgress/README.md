### Progress and Activity

Make loading content in your app as delightful and painless as possible by minimizing the amount of visual change a user sees before they can view and interact with content. Each operation should only be represented by one activity indicatorâ€”for example, one refresh operation should not display both a refresh bar and an activity circle. @see [Material Design Specification](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/progress-activity.html#progress-activity-types-of-indicators)


Circular progress indicators are created with the `<material-circular-progress>` directive.
