    <p>
      CSS grid layout and responsive breakpoints using flexbox. Using the layout attributes makes it easy
      to change columns to rows, and vise versa. Follows the mobile first responsive design pattern,
      meaning it starts at the smallest viewport first and builts up.

    <h3>Responsive Layouts</h3>
    <p>
      The above attributes can also be applied only to certain viewport sizes by using
      specific media query sizes. For example, <code>layout-md</code> would only be
      active when the medium media query is active.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Attribute</th>
        <th nowrap>Viewport Size</th>
        <th>General Device</th>

        <td nowrap>layout-lg</td>

          Large devices

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td nowrap>layout-md</td>
        <td nowrap>>= 960px</td>
        <td>
          Desktops
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td nowrap>layout-sm</td>
        <td nowrap>>= 600px</td>
        <td>
          Tablets
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>layout</td>
        <td>>= 0</td>
        <td>
          An attribute without a size suffix is the default and would be overridden
          by larger sizes. This follows the mobile first responsive design pattern, so
          in many cases this would be the setting for the smallest device, such
          as phone.
        </td>

    </table>



    <h3>Horizontal and Vertical Layouts</h3>
    <p>
      A layout contains cells, and a layout determines if its cells should
      line up horizontally or vertically. In the "Layout A" example they'll always
      be horizonal. In the "Layout B" example they'll always be vertical. In
      "Layout C" it vertical when the viewport is small, and horizontal when larger.
    </p>

    <h3>Flex Cells</h3>
    <p>
      Child cells of <code>layout</code> elements can use the <code>flex</code> attribute to fill
      the available space.
    </p>

      <iframe src="/demo/layout/flex-cell.html"></iframe>
    </iframe-code-view>


    <h3>Layout Padding</h3>
    <p>
      This layout has padding, or gutters, between each cell by adding the
      <code>layout-padding</code> attribute. The previous examples added in their own
      margins/padding manually, whereas the layout-padding attribute spaces it all out
      evenly.
    </p>

      <iframe src="/demo/layout/layout-padding.html"></iframe>
    </iframe-code-view>



    <h3>Layout Padding with Available Space Percents</h3>
    <p>
      Cells can be given integers to represent the percentage of the available space
      it should take up. Note that cells which are not given a percentage still
      fill up the available area. Adjust the window size to see
      the demo's responsive layout attributes at work.

    </iframe-code-view>



    <h3>Layout Padding with Offsets</h3>
    <p>
      Cells can be offset from the left, but still allow the gutters to line up correctly.
      Adjust the window size to see the demo's responsive layout attributes at work.

    <h3>Header, Menu, Main, Footer, no padding</h3>
    <p>
      This layout lets each of the header and footer tracks height be the size of their
      respective content, and the middle track (menu and main) flex vertically to fill the
      space of the entire layout. This is also an example of nested layouts, where the entire
      body is a vertical layout (header/content/footer), and the content row is its own layout
      (menu/main), and each layout has their own settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The body element has the <code>layout="vertical"</code> attribute.
      By default the middle track has the menu and main cells stacked vertically. However,
      the cells line up horizontally starting at the "small" size, which is determined by the
      media query.
