Documentation
-------------

Uses [dgeni](http://github.com/angular/dgeni), the wonderful documentation generator built by [@petebacondarwin](https://github.com/petebacondarwin).

To view docs:

1. `gulp docs`, which builds the docs to `dist/docs`
2. `cd dist/docs` and start an http server (e.g. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`)
3. Navigate to the server, and enjoy (e.g. http://localhost:8000)

Run `gulp watch` to watch and rebuild docs on every save.
